4E 45 53 1A - Static NES header info
10 - # of 16KB PRG blocks
10 - # of 8KB CHR blocks
A2 - Mapper data, unclear on this 
00 - Background mirroring, 00 means it's not
00 00 00 00 - ???
00 00 00 00 - ???
CHR is 128KB, PRG is 256KB; this means that there's 16 banks of each, which the $10 in the thing implies
Conversely, this means that the mapper is $A2 and it appears the second half of the header is just padding for whatever reason
